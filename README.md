Mobi Service Project

F2NEX is the first Brazilian company to create the Exchange itself and a multiservice platform where Mobi will be accepted as payment method

Crypto-currencies are excellent digital assets for investments in the current technological age. To pick up these coins and trade them is an excellent option to the investors, however, there was no Brazilian company that offered the acquisition and commercialization of the coins in its own currency until F2Nex appeared. The company is already born with the mission of revolutionizing an area that is still new to many people in Brazil, but which is already on the rise in other countries.

The F2Nex project is bold to the market. In addition to the MOBI, its own currency; it also launches an Exchange, which is the tool through which transactions occur in the purchase, sale and exchange of assets; and the Mobi Service platform.

The Mobi platform will be fully enabled for the blockchain, which will enable you to carry out various e-commerce activities such as requesting transportation service, buying airfare, ordering food, renting a room, hiring laundry services, buying tickets etc. with the speed and convenience through the Mobi App. 

Before being consolidated as a digital asset there is the Initial Coin Offering (ICO), that is, they are raised capital, as in a collective financing system, which decreases any barrier to the homologation of the crypto-currency.

Sales of the pre-ICO Mobi start on April 15th and close on May 5th. 400 million tokens will be released and will be available for purchase of packages from a thousand coins, which will cost $70 (seventy dollars). Payment can be made with other crypto-coins or credit cards.

Whoever purchases pre-Ico has the following bonuses:
- Those who buy 1000 earn 50% more Mobi tokens;
- Those who acquire 5000 gain more 75% of Mobi tokens;
- Those who buy 10,000 gain 100% more Mobi tokens;
- Those who buy 50,000 gain more 125% Mobi tokens.

Investors and business stakeholders, who lose sales of the pre-ICO Mobi with exclusive advantages, will have another opportunity in the second crowdsale, in which ICO will be traded with 3,600 billion tokens. Packs of 100 tokens will be sold, which will cost Usd 26 each package, or 0.26 cents per Mobi.

Check the dates and bonuses:
- May 10 to 15 will be the 1st phase and those who buy a package earn + 30%;
- May 16 to 20 will be the 2nd phase, where those who buy a package get + 15%;
- June 21 to 25 will be the 3rd phase, where those who buy a package earn + 5%;
- May 26th to 30th will be the 4th phase and those who buy a package get + 0%, meaning they do not earn anything more.
After the pre-Ico and Ico phases, the tokens will be converted into Mobi - which is a global currency, and can be bought or sold in any country, which expands trading with other crypto-coins.

"In Brazil, we do not have competitors, our platform arrives with more than 100 assets for trading and is the first to offer several services that will facilitate the investor's daily life," said Fares Lakis, CEO of F2Nex.

Smart contract is published in Ethereum blockchain.
